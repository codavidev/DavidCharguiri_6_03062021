# Piiquante - Hot Sauce Rating API

Piiquante is a Node.js application that provides a RESTful API for a hot sauce rating application. This project was developed as part of my web developer training to demonstrate my skills in building modern and secure web applications.

## Highlights

- **Robust Architecture**: The application follows best practices in architecture, security, and modularity, ensuring a solid foundation for future development.
- **Enhanced Security**: User passwords are hashed, authentication is handled by JSON Web Tokens, and critical operations require authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Smooth User Experience**: The API offers complete features for managing sauces, users, and ratings, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Production-Ready**: The application is fully functional and can be deployed to production with minimal configuration.

## Demonstrated Skills

- **Node.js**: Mastery of server-side application development with Node.js and Express.js.
- **MongoDB**: Experience with NoSQL databases and using Mongoose for data modeling.
- **Web Security**: In-depth knowledge of web security best practices, including password hashing, JWT authentication, and protection against common attacks.
- **Project Management**: Ability to manage a complete project, from design to implementation, following a structured development methodology.

This project demonstrates my expertise in web development and my commitment to delivering high-quality, secure, and scalable solutions. Feel free to explore the source code and documentation to learn more about my technical skills.
